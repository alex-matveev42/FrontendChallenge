## Running the app

Run `ng i`and then `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. 

## Improvements

1. Add tests
2. Add ability to save several events
3. Create 'user friendly' file in Figma. Because current very difficalt to manage. I mean get elements attributes.
4. For more specific cases we can create set of css attr for @media (orientation: landscape) or  @media (orientation: portrait)
5. maybe create several components for our parts


## Next steps
1. add ability to save severals events
2. add more complex UI with different tabs and so on to mantain events
3. add somekind of remainders not no miss events
